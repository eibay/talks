# Description

Warren Buffett said: "It's good to learn from your mistakes. It's better to learn from other people's mistakes."
As a freelancer, my job is to make data accessible to data scientists. In this talk I'll share common mistakes I've seen in they way companies are handling data and will suggest some ways to avoid it.


# Session Outline

We'll start by the defining the problem of data management and also how it hurts your models.

Then we'll cover several mistakes in data such as:
- Lack of validation
- No data quality metrics
- No versions
- Lack of schema
- ...

We'll also look at some best practices to fix these issues. For example using tools such as cue to validate data.

Plan:
- Introduction: 5min
- Case studies & recommendation: 20min
    - The case of the missing ID. A validation story
    - The case of the failing ingestion. A metrics story
    - The case of the wrong calculation. An ontology story
    - The case of the unhelpful fix. A data origins story
- Summary: 5min

# Audience Takeaway

They should have a data policy in place.
