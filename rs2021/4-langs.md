# Description	
Maslow's hammer states that "If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail." Programming language are the tools you use to solve problems and knowing more than one kind will expand your toolbox and make you a better problem solver.

# Session Outiline	

We'll start by talking about programming languages in general and how they affect your thinking. Then we'll show a simple task and solve it with 4 different types of languages:
- Procedural/OO (Python/Go)
- Assembly (x86)
- Functional (Clojure/Haskell)
- Logic (Prolog)

For each language we'll also see how you can import the knowledge you gain from it to a mainstream language. I'll also provide links to learning resources.

Approximate timing:
- Introduction: 5min
- Procedural: 5min
- Assembly: 5min
- Functional: 5min
- Logic: 5min
- Summary: 5in

# Audience Takeaway	
They should experience with more programming languages.
